# restart-oobe

Experience the boring and annoying OOBE of Windows twice.
It works just like when you run Windows for the first time.

## Compatibility

restart-oobe supports all the versions of Windows that contain an Out-of-Box experience (OOBE).

Some examples are Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

## Usage

Open the well-known Command Prompt (cmd.exe) as Administrator and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the program.
Then, run it from there.

```bash
start restart-oobe_vX.XX.exe
```

## Obtaining the program

You can click [here](https://github.com/KneesDev/restart-oobe/releases/tag/v1.01) to download the latest version of the program.

(in 1.00, there were two variants but I merged them into one for easier usage)
