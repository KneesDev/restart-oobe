# restart-oobe

Experience the boring and annoying OOBE of Windows twice.
It works just like when you run Windows for the first time.

## Compatibility

There are 2 different *editions* of each version.

The first one is made for Windows 8.1 or newer and the second one is made for Windows Vista and up to Windows 8.

## Usage

Open the well-known Command Prompt (cmd.exe) as Administrator and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the program.
Then, run it from there.

```bash
start restart-oobe.exe
```

## Obtaining the program

You can click [here](https://github.com/KneesDev/restart-oobe/releases) to download the latest version of the program.

Just make sure to click the right file, which is restart-oobe_vX.XX.exe
